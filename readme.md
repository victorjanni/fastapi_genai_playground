# 🚀 FastAPI GenAI Playground

A hands-on playground to learn and build **FastAPI backend systems**, **CRUD APIs**, and extend into **GenAI / AI engineering**.

This project is designed to help you move from:

* Basic API development
  ➡️ To
* Real-world AI backend architecture

---

# 📌 Overview

This repository includes:

* ✅ FastAPI CRUD project (Employee Management)
* ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM integration
* ✅ Pydantic schemas
* ✅ SQLite database
* 🔜 Future GenAI integrations (OpenAI, LangChain, RAG, Agents)
